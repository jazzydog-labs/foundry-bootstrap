# TODO

- [ ] Confirm apt package names for all tools and handle packages not available on apt.
- [ ] Improve Linux pyenv installation (handle dependencies, offline archives).
- [ ] Add support for additional package managers or distributions beyond Debian-based.
- [ ] Automate installation of PyYAML or switch to pure bash parsing to avoid dependency during bootstrapping.
- [ ] Resolve network restrictions for package installation in container environments.
